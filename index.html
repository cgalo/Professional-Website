            <h3>Hola!</h3>
            <p>
                In 2015, I started my undergraduate career at North Park University where I was a student-athlete
                majoring in Physics & Engineering. I was a runner for the cross country team, as well as the
                track & field team. North Park is where I fell in love with coding and economics and decided to transfer
                to the University of Toledo to pursue my passion in both, majoring in computer science with a minor in
                economics. I started at UToledo in the Spring of 2017 and my expected graduation date is December 2020.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, I have been able to be part of different groups that have helped me develop as a person and
                as a professional. Currently, I'm an active member of the professional business fraternity, Pi Sigma
                Epsilon. This is where I've had the honor to grow my business skills, create a bigger network of
                connections, and collaborate on projects to further improvement of our fraternity and its members. I am
                also developing the website for PSE for our chapter in UToledo, the website is being hosted through
                Google Cloud, where I deployed a LAMP (Linux, Apache, mySQL, PHP) stack to host the WordPress website.
                You can check the website <a href="http://pseutoledo.org" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I was an intern at <a href="https://onpointgroup.com/" target="_blank">OnPoint Group</a> a Salesforce Developer intern, located in Perrysburg OH.
                From July 2019 to December 2019 I've worked on developing custom applications on their Salesforce
                platform, which uses its proprietary object-oriented language called
                <a href="https://sforce.co/32ff2pN" target="_blank">Apex</a>. I also create lightning web-components
                using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Apex. This internship gave me the opportunity to experience development first hand,
                while learning JavaScript and Apex through my projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined <a href="https://www.quickenloans.com/" target="_blank">Quicken Loans</a> and its family of companies in January 2020, as an intern in their Information Security family in Detroit MI.
                Here I had the pleasure to work in various inside teams such as Cloud Security, Compliance, and Software and Asset Licensing (SLAM) teams. 
                I was able to work on the security compliance of QL's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/" target="_blank">AWS</a> resources,
                holding accountable our teams for their tag compliance in order to reduce cost and up time of EC2 and S3 resources. 
                With the SLAM team I automated their Asset Management Application by pushing PowerShell scripts to our its server. These scripts automated the
                refreshing our users data, by collecting accurate information from Active Directory, and uploading back to the server. Also, sending weekly reports of 
                unused licenses that could be recycle, given to a different user, or sent to review to stop paying for those licenses.
                By the end of my internship I was working with our Compliance team for the <a href="https://bit.ly/3hOG68a" target="_blank"> SOC (Service Organization Control) Type 2 audit</a>.
                I assisted in the reviewing of controls and deliverables requested by our external auditors, as well as handling the evidence, and findings, of self-service deliverables.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently I joined another of Quicken Loans' companies, <a href="https://www.nexsystech.com/" target="_blank">Nexsys Technologies</a>, as a Software Engineer Intern.
                I will be working in their <a href="https://www.nexsystech.com/clear-sign/" target="_blank">ClearSign application</a>, on both their front-end, utilizing AngularJS, and their back-end,
                consisting of ASP.Net and C#.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently on the hunt for new opportunities to keep learning and expanding my knowledge,
                with the goal to become a software engineer, information security engineer, or data scientist professional after graduation.

                                SPAN is a <a href="https://bit.ly/2BqrLhC" target="_blank">Command Line Application </a> that utilizes
                                two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree" target="_blank">Minimimal Spanning Tree algorithms</a>, Kruskal and Prim's algorithms to be specific. 
                                The program requires the location of the text file, which should contain the data of a graph, and then returns the results of each algorithm. For more information you can
